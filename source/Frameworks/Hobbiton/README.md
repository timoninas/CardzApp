# Hobbiton

**Hobbiton swift package using for foundation and extensions**

*Hobbiton was located in the center of the Shire in the far eastern part of the Westfarthing. It was the home of many illustrious Hobbits, including Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. Notable locations in Hobbiton include the Mill and Bag End. At the end of the War of the Ring, Saruman's treachery destroyed much of the Shire, and Hobbiton suffered greatly. The Old Mill had been replaced with a noxious factory-like structure, and many trees had been cut down*
